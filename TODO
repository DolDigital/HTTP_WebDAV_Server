Short term:
- streams support for GET and PUT
  - no need to create headers for GET yourself
	- PUT may just return a stream to write to
	- partial GET/PUT support, see below
	- automatic mime type guessing when 
	  ext/mime_magic is available and supporting
		streams ...
  (work already in progress)
- GET and PUT should allow Range: requests
  for partial reads, writes and updates
  (work already in progress)
- the XML parsing parts are *very* Q&D
  should maybe use XML_Parser and XML_Tree 
  (as soon as these support namespaces)
- "Depth: Infinite" not supported yet
- MIME-type detection should become a
  package of its own?
- provide helper classes that extend the
  Server class by adding prepared LOCKing 
  functionality, eg.:
	- HTTP_WebDAV_Server_Lock_MySQL
	- HTTP_WebDAV_Server_Lock_dbm
	- HTTP_WebDAV_Server_Lock_PearDB
  - ...
- mimetype may be guessed for strem

Long term:
- Versioning 
- DASL
- ...
