This code depends on code introduced into the developement branch for
PHP 4.3, so for now it will only work with CVS builds. 

The code requires the PHP ini values 'always_populate_raw_post_data' 
and 'allow_webdav_methods' to be set. You can do that globaly in your
php.ini file, but if possible you should restrict these options to
directories where they are really needed.

With Apache you can do this  by setting them in a <directory> 
environment in your httpd.conf file or in a local .htaccess file
by using

  php_value always_populate_raw_post_data 1
  php_value allow_webdav_methods 1
